<h1>Page 3 AJAX</h1>
<p>This page is called by a HTTP GET method as you would normally do when you click on a link</p>
<p>However, in a Single Page Application, we can use Javascript to call the new content without "reloading" the main page.</p>
<p>In the dev tools network tab, we see a HTTP request is called to retrieve the contents of this page</p>
